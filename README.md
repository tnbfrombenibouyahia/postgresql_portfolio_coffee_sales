â˜• Coffee Sales Analysis â€“ PostgreSQL & Python

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of a French coffee shop chain using PostgreSQL for database management and Python for data visualization.
The goal is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow, from database creation to business insights, while showcasing technical skills in SQL and Python.

ðŸ›  Technical Stack
PostgreSQL â€“ Database creation, table management, and SQL queries.
SQL â€“ Data aggregation, joins, grouping, and performance optimization with indexes.
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) â€“ Automating query execution and generating visualizations.

ðŸ“‚ Project Steps
1 - Database Setup
    Created a PostgreSQL database (coffee_sales).
    Designed and created tables: stores, products, customers, sales.
    Imported CSV datasets using \copy for efficient bulk loading.

2 - SQL Queries
    Wrote multiple analytical queries to answer business questions:
      a - Revenue per product.
      b - Gross margin by product category.
      c - Revenue by store region.
      d - Monthly revenue trends.
      e - Top 10 customers by spending.

3 - Data Visualization with Python
    Connected Python to PostgreSQL using psycopg2 and pandas.
    Automated query execution and chart generation.
    Saved visualizations as .png files for reporting and documentation.
